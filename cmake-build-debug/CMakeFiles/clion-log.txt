CMake Warning at video4linux/CMakeLists.txt:13 (FIND_PACKAGE):
  By not providing "FindARM.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "ARM", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ARM" with any of
  the following names:

    ARMConfig.cmake
    arm-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ARM" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "ARM_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "ARM" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
